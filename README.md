Flight Management System

Developed using core Java enterprise technology, the Flight Management System is an end-to-end solution for managing inbound and outbound flights at an international airport. 

Users can create, edit, and delete flights in a Web user interface that connects to a back-end Java application and a MySQL database. 

The Web interface is designed as a single-page application using Ajax and JavaScript.

•	Used Java Servlets to create API endpoints to route HTTP requests. 
•	Configured and set up Servlets in the web.xml deployment descriptor.
•	Utilized JDBC to make CRUD operations to the database. Made transactions to a MySQL database using SQL to query and update data.
•	Built WAR file using Maven to be deployed to a Tomcat server.
•	Created UI and single-page application using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and AJAX to make HTTP requests to the API.
